# japwgen-pp - Just Another Pwgen - PlusPlus
A very simple password generator very similar to [pwgen](https://github.com/tytso/pwgen).
This is more of a personal project and should probably not be used in any kind of production
environment, see the aforementioned [pwgen](https://github.com/tytso/pwgen) or similar for
such use cases.
